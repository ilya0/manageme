# ManageMe
## Music Artist Self management app

### I'm trying to create an app where artists have aplicatins they can use to manage themselves online and that will connect to the various apis to push music, tweets, and interaction in one place.


Ideas on what to create:
- Page for auto epk
- Page to put all info from socials to realease a track
    - insta
    - twitter
    - snapchat?
    - facebook

    * possible other idea for pushing to socials
        - reminder to create social post every day
        - check list

- live stream page to facebok and periscop and the other one I forget what its called
- auto contact and email promotors
- auto email followers
    - maybe use some sort of mailchimp integration
- auto EPK
- MUltiple layouts?
- Automated weeklog posts?


- Find wedding sites and make a automated timeline where music can be released

- guide on how to release music

- automated music manager sending emails to promotors and people that need to be upkept with

- section to create epk or press kit

- need to develop a way to store everything

- users and data schemas
- automation of everything
- Maybe use react for front end? So I can learn it

- need to talk to more musicians and managers
- 


Steps to app 

1. Create front page
2. creat back end node for support of front page
3. start creating the pages and modifying the backend to support the front
4. load up NPMs that you need
